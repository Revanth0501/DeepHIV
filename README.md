DeepHIV is a robust model based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) designed for predicting the inhibition strength of molecules against HIV drugs. This project takes advantage of SMILES structures as input, generates molecule structures, and utilizes the GNN model to make accurate predictions.

**FEATURES**

- Takes SMILES structure as input.
- Generates molecule structure.
- Predicts inhibition strength against HIV drugs using Graph Neural Networks.

**SETUP**

The project setup can be done by following procedures:

Create a new Environment
```
conda create -p ru python -y
```
Install all the required packages in the Environment

```
 pip install -r requirement.txt
```
